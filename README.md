3. Run the project using `yarn start`.
```

## Breif:

```
Project uses github's api to search repos and then allows to sort the repos based on stars, forks & watchers. This is simple project that demonstrates use of react-router, redux, redux-thunk.
The components are generally very small and hence not being split into the widely known Container Component & Presentational Component Pattern.
